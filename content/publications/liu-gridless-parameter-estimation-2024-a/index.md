abstract: Spatial frequency estimation from a mixture of noisy sinusoids finds applications
  in various fields. While subspace-based methods offer cost-effective super-resolution
  parameter estimation, they demand precise array calibration, posing challenges for
  large antennas. In contrast, sparsity-based approaches outperform subspace methods,
  especially in scenarios with limited snapshots or correlated sources. This study
  focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using a partly calibrated rectangular
  array with fully calibrated subarrays. A gridless sparse formulation leveraging
  shift invariances in the array is developed, yielding two competitive algorithms
  under the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and successive convex
  approximation frameworks, respectively. Numerical simulations show the superior
  error performance of our proposed method, particularly in highly correlated scenarios,
  compared to the conventional subspace-based methods. It is demonstrated that the
  proposed formulation can also be adopted in the fully calibrated case to improve
  the robustness of the subspace-based methods to the source correlation. Furthermore,
  we provide a generalization of the proposed method to a more challenging case where
  a part of the sensors is unobservable due to failures.
