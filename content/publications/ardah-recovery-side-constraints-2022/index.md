abstract: This chapter addresses sparse signal reconstruction under various types
  of structural side constraints with applications in multi-antenna systems. Side
  constraints may result from prior information on the measurement system and the
  sparse signal structure. They may involve the structure of the sensing matrix, the
  structure of the non-zero support values, the temporal structure of the sparse representation
  vector, and the nonlinear measurement structure. First, we demonstrate how a priori
  information in the form of structural side constraints influence recovery guarantees
  (null space properties) using $ell$1-minimization. Furthermore, for constant modulus
  signals, signals with row, block, and rank sparsity, as well as non-circular signals,
  we illustrate how structural prior information can be used to devise efficient algorithms
  with improved recovery performance and reduced computational complexity. Finally,
  we address the measurement system design for linear and nonlinear measurements of
  sparse signals. To this end, we derive a new linear mixing matrix design based on
  coherence minimization. Then, we extend our focus to nonlinear measurement systems
  where we design parallel optimization algorithms to efficiently compute stationary
  points in the sparse phase-retrieval problem with and without dictionary learning.
